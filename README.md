### DSCI320 - Analyzing Trends in Library Usage Across the Five Most Frequented San Francisco County Libraries

This project was completed in Fall 2023 as part of the 3rd-year course, DSCI 320: Visualization for Data Science. The goal was to analyze trends in library patron behavior using a dataset from the San Francisco Public Library by designing and implementing interactive visualizations. By creating multiple visualizations and integrating them into a dashboard, we examined how different age demographics engage with library services, the variation in checkouts over time, and seasonal trends in patron activity. This project provided hands-on experience with design processes in data visualization.
